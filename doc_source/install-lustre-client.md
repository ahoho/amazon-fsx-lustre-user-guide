# Installing the Lustre Client<a name="install-lustre-client"></a>

To mount your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system from a Linux instance, first install the open\-source Lustre client\. Amazon FSx supports access from the 2\.10 versions of the Lustre client\. Then, depending on your operating system version, use one of the following procedures\. If your compute instance isn't running the Linux kernel specified in the installation instructions, and you can't change the kernel, you can build your own Lustre client\. For more information, see [Compiling Lustre](http://wiki.lustre.org/Compiling_Lustre) on the Lustre wiki\.

## To Install the Lustre Client as an RPM Package \(Amazon Linux 2\)<a name="install-lustre-client-amazon-linux-2"></a>

1. Open a terminal on your client\.

1. Determine which kernel is currently running on your compute instance by running the following command\. The Lustre client requires Amazon Linux kernel 4\.14, version 104 or higher\. 

   ```
   uname -r
   ```

1. Do one of the following:
   + If the command returns `4.14.104-95.84.amzn2.x86_64` or a higher version of 4\.14, download and install the Lustre client with the following command\.

     ```
     sudo amazon-linux-extras install -y lustre2.10
     ```
   +  If the command returns a result less than 4\.14\.104, update the kernel and reboot your Amazon EC2 instance by running the following command\. 

     ```
     sudo yum -y update kernel && sudo reboot
     ```

     Confirm that the kernel has been updated using the uname \-r command\. Then download and install the Lustre client as described above\.

1. Determine which kernel is currently running on the compute instance with the following command\.

   ```
   uname -r
   ```

1. Do one of the following:
   + If the instance is running kernel version `3.10.0-862.*`, download and install the Lustre 2\.10\.5 client with the following commands\. The client comes in two packages to download and install\.

     ```
     sudo yum -y install https://downloads.whamcloud.com/public/lustre/lustre-2.10.5/el7/client/RPMS/x86_64/kmod-lustre-client-2.10.5-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
     sudo yum -y install https://downloads.whamcloud.com/public/lustre/lustre-2.10.5/el7/client/RPMS/x86_64/lustre-client-2.10.5-1.el7.x86_64.rpm

     ```
     sudo yum -y install https://downloads.whamcloud.com/public/lustre/lustre-2.10.8/el7/client/RPMS/x86_64/kmod-lustre-client-2.10.8-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
     sudo yum -y install https://downloads.whamcloud.com/public/lustre/lustre-2.10.8/el7/client/RPMS/x86_64/lustre-client-2.10.8-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
     ```
   + If the instance is running kernel `3.10.0-1062.*` or greater, see [To Install the Lustre Client as an RPM Package \(CentOS and Red Hat 7\.7 and Newer\)](#install-lustre-client-Centos-7) for instructions on how to install the Lustre Client from the Amazon FSx yum package repository\.

**Note**  
You might need to reboot your compute instance for the client to finish installing\.

## To Install the Lustre Client as an RPM Package \(CentOS and Red Hat 7\.7 and Newer\)<a name="install-lustre-client-Centos-7"></a>

**Note**  
The following procedure is not for CentOS and Red Hat 8\.

Lustre client packages that are compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux \(RHEL\) and CentOS can be installed and updated from the Amazon FSx yum package repository\. These packages are signed to ensure they have not been tampered with before or during download\. Installation fails if the corresponding public key has not been installed on your system\.

1. Open a terminal on your client\.

1. Install the Amazon FSx rpm public key by using the following command\.

   ```
   sudo wget https://fsx-lustre-client-repo-public-keys.s3.amazonaws.com/fsx-rpm-public-key.asc -O /tmp/fsx-rpm-public-key.asc
   ```

1. Import the key by using the following command\.

   ```
   sudo rpm --import /tmp/fsx-rpm-public-key.asc
   ```

1. Add the repository and update the package manager\. Use the following command\.

   ```
   sudo wget https://fsx-lustre-client-repo.s3.amazonaws.com/el/7/fsx-lustre-client.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/aws-fsx.repo
   ```

   To stay on a specific version of RHEL and avoid moving to later versions as they are released, you can edit this repository configuration file\.

**To install a specific version of RHEL**

1. Edit the repository configuration file to point to the specific version of RHEL that you want to stay on:

   1.  Install a specific version by providing the version in the following command\. 

      ```
      sudo sed -i 's#7#specific version#' /etc/yum.repos.d/aws-fsx.repo
      ```

      For example, if you want to stay on version 7\.7 specifically, substitute `specific version` with 7\.7 in the command\.

      ```
      sudo sed -i 's#7#7.7#' /etc/yum.repos.d/aws-fsx.repo
      ```

   1. Use the following command to clear the yum cache\.

      ```
      sudo yum clean all
      ```

1. Install the packages from the repository\. Use the following command\.

   ```
   sudo yum install -y kmod-lustre-client lustre-client
   ```

### Additional Information \(CentOS and RedHat 7\.7 and Newer\)<a name="lustre-client-Centos-7-additional-info"></a>

The commands preceding install the two packages that are necessary for mounting and interacting with your Amazon FSx file system\. Additional Lustre packages such as a package containing the source code and packages containing tests are included in the repository, and you can optionally install them\. To list all available packages in the repository, use the following command\. 

```
yum --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo="aws-fsx" list available
```

To download the source rpm, containing a tarball of the upstream source code and the set of patches we have applied, use the following command\.

```
 sudo yumdownloader --source kmod-lustre-client
```

When you run yum update, a more recent version of the module is installed if available and the existing version is replaced\. To prevent the currently installed version from being removed on update, add a line like the following to your `/etc/yum.conf` file\.

```
installonlypkgs=kernel, kernel-big‚Äêmem, kernel-enterprise, kernel-smp,
              kernel-debug, kernel-unsupported, kernel-source, kernel-devel, kernel-PAE,
              kernel-PAE-debug, kmod-lustre-client
```

 This list includes the default install only packages, specified in the `yum.conf` man page, and the `kmod-lustre-client` package\.

## To Install the Lustre Client as an RPM Package \(SUSE Linux 12 SP3\)<a name="install-lustre-client-SUSE-Linux"></a>

**Note**  
You might need to reboot your compute instance for the client to finish installing\.

## To Install the Lustre Client as a \.deb Package \(Ubuntu 16\.04\)<a name="install-lustre-client-Ubuntu-16"></a>

You can get Lustre packages from the Ubuntu 16\.04 Amazon FSx repository\. To validate that the contents of the repository have not been tampered with before or during download, a GNU Privacy Guard \(GPG\) signature is applied to the metadata of the repository\. Installing the repository fails unless you have the correct public GPG key installed on your system\. 

1. Open a terminal on your client\.

1. Follow these steps to add the Amazon FSx Ubuntu repository:

   1. If you have not previously registered an Amazon FSx Ubuntu repository on your client instance, download and install the public key\. Use the following command\.

      ```
      wget -O - https://fsx-lustre-client-repo-public-keys.s3.amazonaws.com/fsx-ubuntu-public-key.asc | sudo apt-key add -
      ```

   1. Add the Amazon FSx package repository to your local package manager\. Use the following command\.

      ```
      sudo bash -c 'echo "deb https://fsx-lustre-client-repo.s3.amazonaws.com/ubuntu xenial main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/fsxlustreclientrepo.list && apt-get update'
      ```

1. Determine which kernel is currently running on your client instance, and update as needed\. The Lustre client on Ubuntu 16\.04 requires kernel 4\.4\.0\-1092\-aws or later\.

   1. Run the following command to determine which kernel is running\. 

      ```
      uname -r
      ```

   1. Run the following command to update to the latest Ubuntu kernel and Lustre version and then reboot\.

      ```
      sudo apt install -y linux-aws lustre-client-modules-aws && sudo reboot
      ```

      If your kernel version is greater than 4\.4\.0\-1092\-aws and you don‚Äôt want to update to the latest kernel version, you can install Lustre for the current kernel with the following command\.

      ```
      sudo apt install -y lustre-client-modules-$(uname -r)
      ```

      The two Lustre packages that are necessary for mounting and interacting with your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system are installed\. You can optionally install additional related packages such as a package containing the source code and packages containing tests that are included in the repository\.

   1. List all available packages in the repository by using the following command\.

      ```
      sudo apt-cache search ^lustre
      ```

   1. \(Optional\) If you want your system upgrade to also always upgrade Lustre client modules, make sure that the lustre\-client\-modules\-aws package is installed using the following command\.

      ```
      sudo apt install -y lustre-client-modules-aws
      ```

**Note**  
If you get a `Module Not Found error`, do the following:  
Downgrade your kernel to the latest supported version\. List all available versions of the lustre\-client\-modules package and install the corresponding kernel\. To do this, use the following command\.  

```
sudo apt-cache search lustre-client-modules
```
For example, if the latest version that is included in the repository is `lustre-client-modules-4.4.0-1092-aws`, do the following:  
Install the kernel this package was built for\. Use the following commands\.  

   ```
   sudo apt-get install -y linux-image-4.4.0-1092-aws
   ```

   ```
   sudo sed -i 's/GRUB_DEFAULT=.\+/GRUB\_DEFAULT="Advanced options for Ubuntu>Ubuntu, with Linux 4.4.0-1099-aws"/' /etc/default/grub
   ```

   ```
   sudo update-grub
   ```
Reboot your instance\. Use the following command\.  

   ```
   sudo reboot
   ```
Install the Lustre client\. Use the following command\.  

   ```
   sudo apt-get install -y lustre-client-modules-$(uname -r)
   ```
